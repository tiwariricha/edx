2021-04-30 05:33:21,677 WARNING 2688 [py.warnings] [user None] [ip None] warnings.py:109 - /edx/app/edxapp/venvs/edxapp/lib/python3.8/site-packages/storages/backends/s3boto.py:41: DeprecationWarning: The S3BotoStorage backend is deprecated in favor of the S3Boto3Storage backend and will be removed in django-storages 1.8. This backend is mostly in bugfix only mode and has been for quite a while (in much the same way as its underlying library 'boto'). For performance, security and new feature reasons it is _strongly_ recommended that you update to the S3Boto3Storage backend. Please see the migration docs https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html#migrating-boto-to-boto3.
